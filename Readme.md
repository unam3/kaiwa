Kaiwa [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ForNeVeR/kaiwa.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/ForNeVeR/kaiwa)
=====
Kaiwa is an open source web client for XMPP.  

Our production server is http://chat.jabber.ru

Alpha version is always hosted on http://kaiwa.fornever.me (**warning: there may
be highly unstable code there, you're recommended to use test accounts with this
server**).

Kaiwa is a fork of [Otalk][otalk], a prototype application created by &yet.

## Installing

First of all, clone the repository, install the dependencies and configure the
application:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ForNeVeR/kaiwa.git
    $ cd kaiwa
    $ npm install
    $ cp dev_config.example.json dev_config.json # and edit the file

After that compile the application:

    $ npm run compile

And start the server:

    $ npm start

For the development purposes you may use

    $ npm run devel-nix # or devel-win for Windows environment

It will continously monitor the `src` directory for changes and recompile
application on any change.

It you want to publish the compiled application somewhere else, feel free to
drop the `public` directory to any web server. You could need to setup MIME
types, please consult `src/server.js` if you need to.

*Note:* If you're running your own XMPP server, and aren't using something like
HAProxy to terminate SSL, then you might get errors in certain browsers trying
to establish a WebSocket connection because the XMPP server is requesting an
optional client certificate which makes the browser terminate the socket. To
resolve that, visit the XMPP over Websocket URL directly (eg,
`example.com:5281/xmpp-websocket` for Prosody) so that a client cert choice can
be made. After that, the Kaiwa client should connect fine.

## Configuration

Application configuration is taken from `dev_config.json` file.

`server.sasl` is optional parameter that can be used to configure the
authentication scheme. It can be a single string or a priority list. The default
priorities as defined by [stanza.io][] are `['external', 'scram-sha-1',
'digest-md5', 'plain', 'anonymous']`.

You may enable XMPP pings by setting the `server.keepalive.interval` (time
between ping attempts) and `server.keepalive.timeout` (timeout to close the
connection if pong was not received); both of these are in seconds. If
`server.keepalive` is not defined, then XMPP ping will use the default settings
(with interval of 5 minutes).

## What's included?

Kaiwa comes with support for:

### Message History Syncing

Using Message Archive Management (MAM, [XEP-0313](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html)), your conversations can be archived by your server and pulled down by the Kaiwa client on demand.

### Active Chat Syncing

Ever used multiple IM clients at once, or swapped clients, and end up with disjointed conversations? Using Message Carbons [(XEP-0280)](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0280.html) all of your active conversations will be synced to your Kaiwa client (and vice versa if you other clients support carbons too).

### Reliable Connections

Sometimes you just lose your Internet connection, but with Stream Mangagement [XEP-0198](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html) your current session can be instantly resumed and caught up once you regain connection. Your messages will show as gray until they've been confirmed as received by your server.

### Message Correction

Made a typo in a message? Using Message Correction [XEP-0308](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0308.html) you can just double tap the up arrow to edit and send a corrected version. In other clients that support correction, your last message will be updated in place and marked as edited.

### Timezone Indications

Working with someone in a different timezone? If the other person is using Kaiwa or another client that supports Entity Time ([XEP-0202](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0202.html)) you'll see a reminder that they're 9 hours away where it's 4am and they're not likely to respond.
